                This project simulates the functionality of a personal computer,
                providing users with a virtual experience of starting, running,
                and shutting down a PC. It begins by simulating the power-on
                sequence, where users can interact with the boot-up process. The
                system mimics a real computer's operations, including loading
                the operating system, managing resources, and launching
                applications. The goal is to educate users on the steps a
                computer goes through to start and function.
              </span>
              <span class="extra-text">
                The simulation provides an interactive environment where users
                can engage with different system components, such as the CPU,
                memory, and storage. The PC simulation also features a simulated
                file system, where users can create, delete, and manage files,
                mimicking the user experience of an actual computer. In
                addition, users can interact with different software,
                replicating real-world application launches and processes. The
                user interface is designed to resemble a common operating
                system, with desktop icons, taskbars, and system alerts. This
                project aims to help users understand the inner workings of a PC
                in a hands-on way. Through this interactive simulation, users
                can also learn troubleshooting steps, such as dealing with
                system crashes or hardware failures. The project is designed to
                be educational, offering tutorials and guided exercises. These
                exercises help users understand system architecture, operating
                systems, and the relationship between hardware and software. It
                also includes a feature to simulate system updates, allowing
                users to experience how software updates are deployed on a real
                computer. For those interested in IT and computer science, this
                simulation provides valuable learning opportunities. It is also
                a great tool for individuals unfamiliar with computers who want
                to get comfortable with basic PC operations. The system is built
                with a modular design, allowing for easy expansion to include
                more advanced features, such as network simulations or cloud
                services. Additionally, the project offers various difficulty
                levels, so users of all skill levels can enjoy and learn from
                it. The simulation provides instant feedback, so users can
                understand what went wrong during a particular process and learn
                from their mistakes. It’s designed to be intuitive, requiring no
                prior knowledge of computers to get started. Overall, this
                project makes learning about computer systems more accessible,
                fun, and interactive. It’s an excellent resource for classrooms,
                online learning platforms, and individual users who want to
                deepen their understanding of computers.
